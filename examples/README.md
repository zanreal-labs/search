## üõ†Ô∏è Common Patterns & Recipes

### Quick Search Pattern

```javascript
import { quickSearch } from '@zanreal/universal-search';

// Fastest way to search - returns just the items
const results = quickSearch(data, query);
```

### Detailed Search Pattern

```javascript
import { search } from '@zanreal/universal-search';

// Full control with scoring and configuration
const results = search(data, query, {
  fieldWeights: { title: 10, description: 5 },
  fuzzyThreshold: 0.7
});
```

### Reusable Searcher Pattern

```javascript
import { createSearcher } from '@zanreal/universal-search';

// Create once, use many times for better performance
const searcher = createSearcher({
  fieldWeights: { name: 10, email: 5 },
  fuzzyThreshold: 0.7
});

const results = searcher(data, query);
```

### Performance-Optimized Pattern

```javascript
// Pre-filter large datasets when possible
const filteredData = data.filter(item => item.category === 'Electronics');
const results = search(filteredData, query, { limit: 20 });
```

### Analytics Pattern

```javascript
const results = search(data, query);
const analytics = {
  totalResults: results.length,
  avgScore: results.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.score, 0) / results.length,
  topCategories: results.map(r => r.item.category)
};
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Field Weight Guidelines

| Field Type | Weight Range | Use Case | Example |
|------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| **Primary Identifiers** | 15-20 | Names, titles, SKUs | `name: 20` |
| **Important Content** | 10-15 | Descriptions, summaries | `description: 12` |
| **Secondary Content** | 5-10 | Categories, tags | `category: 8` |
| **Searchable Text** | 3-5 | Body content, reviews | `content: 4` |
| **Auxiliary Data** | 1-3 | IDs, timestamps | `id: 1` |

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Limit Results**: Use the `limit` option for large datasets
2. **Pre-filter**: Filter data before searching when possible
3. **Field Selection**: Specify `fields` array to search only relevant fields
4. **Fuzzy Threshold**: Adjust `fuzzyThreshold` based on your use case (0.7 is usually good)
5. **Caching**: Cache searcher instances for repeated use with same configuration

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Presets

### Strict Matching (Exact matches preferred)

```javascript
{
  fuzzyThreshold: 0.9,
  minFuzzyLength: 5
}
```

### Loose Matching (Typo-tolerant)

```javascript
{
  fuzzyThreshold: 0.5,
  minFuzzyLength: 2
}
```

### Title-First Search (Prioritize titles/names)

```javascript
{
  fieldWeights: { title: 20, content: 1 }
}
```

### Balanced Search (Equal importance)

```javascript
{
  fieldWeights: { title: 8, description: 5, content: 3 }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Your Search

Each example includes sample data and queries you can modify to test different scenarios:

1. **Modify the sample data** to match your use case
2. **Adjust field weights** to see how results change
3. **Try different search queries** including typos and partial matches
4. **Experiment with configuration options** like fuzzy thresholds

## üìö Next Steps

1. **Start with `basic-usage.mjs`** to understand fundamentals
2. **Choose the example closest to your use case** and adapt it
3. **Read the main README.md** for API documentation
4. **Check out the test files** in `/tests/` for more usage patterns
5. **Review `PUBLISHING.md`** if you're building on top of this library
